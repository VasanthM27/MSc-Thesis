# MSc Research Project: Impact of 3D Printing on Spare Parts Supply Chain

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository showcasing the outcomes of my MSc research project, where I investigate the transformative influence of 3D printing on the spare parts supply chain. This exploration focuses on the intricate interplay between additive manufacturing technologies, spare parts design, and the optimization of supply chain processes.

## Structure of the Project

- **Chapter I: Setting the Stage**
  - A concise overview of the research topic and its objectives.

- **Chapter II: Navigating the Landscape**
  - Deep dive into the realm of additive manufacturing, 3D printing technologies, and their applications within supply chains.

- **Chapter III: Unveiling the Methodology**
  - Insight into the research design, data collection methods, and the interview process employed during this project.

- **Chapter IV: Data Dive**
  - Detailed information extracted from the 3D printing facility and spare parts supplier in Taiwan.

- **Chapter V: Insights and Challenges**
  - Analysis of the collected data, discussion on the influence of 3D printing on spare parts design, and identification of limitations.

- **Chapter VI: Wrapping Up**
  - A summarization of key findings and conclusions derived from the extensive research.

## Key Discoveries

- Significance of 3D printing in producing metal spare parts for diverse applications.
- Advantages of 3D printing include on-demand delivery, streamlined supply chains, and reduced production costs.

## Challenges and Recommendations

- Lack of economy of scale in 3D printing.
- Slower production speed compared to conventional mass production.
- Material limitations and occasional quality issues with printed spare parts.

## References

- A comprehensive list of references utilized throughout the project, including research papers and journals.
